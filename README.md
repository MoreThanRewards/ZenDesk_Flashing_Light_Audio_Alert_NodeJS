# ZenDesk_Flashing_Light_Audio_Alert_NodeJS
AUTHOR: http://sexyhackers.com    Please follow us cuz we post new shirt designs every week!  @TLDR   When ZenDesk tickets don't get responded to in a certain amount of time lights then this script turns on up to 10 electrical devices making lights and buzzers flash and go beep beep.   This causes the customer service people to be really annoyed and respond to tickets faster.    We did this for fun so, if you like it and want to help us out spread the word about our t-shirts website http://sexyhackers.com so we can eat TacoBell!   If you like any of our designs buy some of our swag!   We use these lights : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019I13EQI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  We use this IP controled electrial switch (which you'll need):  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZWD146/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
